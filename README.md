# Post-Service-Spring

Spring backend project, which consisted of four sub-domains (Post, Comment, User, and Role) and Two complementary domains (Logger and Exception) to establish a seamless and intuitive user experience. To ensure high performance and reliability, the Logger domain was used to capture audit details for each request, while the Exception domain was used to handle and track errors. By applying domain-driven design principles and collaborating closely with my team members, we were able to deliver a robust and scalable backend system.
